<h1>Open Table Clone</h1>

<h2>Background</h2><br>
<p>I will be recreating the successful online, table reservation app called OpenTable. This app will consist of multiple parts.</p>
<p>The first will be a splash page that will allow user auth for both an admin and a guest. The splash page will contain a search feature to look for nearby restaurants and whether they have any open reservations for the desired time and date. It will also include a rotating chyron at the bottom used for displaying nearby restaurants with open tables.</p>
<p>The guest user will have a profile page where they can look at past reservations they have made and upcoming reservations they have booked, as well as functionality to cancel or edit those reservations.</p>
<p>Each featured restaurant will have a page to display their open tables, a link to their menu, restaurant rules and reviews, both starred and written. You do not have to be logged in to view the restaurants information but you DO need to be logged in to make a reservation.</p>
<p>The admin will have the priviledge of being able to add restaurants and their information as well as the details regarding their upcoming availability.</p>
